# Airbnb-Case-Study-NYC
Our project on Airbnb data from 2019 was a collaborative effort aimed at gaining insights into the factors that contributed to a decline in revenue. We started by carefully cleaning the data, ensuring that it was accurate and reliable. This was a critical step as it allowed us to conduct a thorough analysis that provided valuable insights into the performance of Airbnb. Using Tableau, we created a series of visually stunning dashboards that showcased our findings, highlighting which neighborhoods and types of properties performed better. Our analysis was both comprehensive and insightful, providing a deep understanding of the business and its operations.
